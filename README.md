### Detail search 
Here shows the detailed search process. Here you can set all the search parameters that are specified when advertising. For example, pet type, breed, crossbreed factor for dogs and much more. Please also note that error handling has been implemented: if the user, for example, wants to select the features of a pet without selecting a type, he will be shown a corresponding view with a warning that he must first select a type, and then he can select features inherent to a certain type.

### Adding publication
Here shows the process of publishing an ad, using the example of publishing a dog for sale. The process begins with choosing the type of diesel engine. Further here, since the type of ‚Äúdog‚Äù was chosen, it is proposed to select the breed cross factor. If the dog's breed is a crossbreed, the user is given the opportunity to choose two breeds. Next, parameters such as age, gender, and characteristics of the pet inherent to the selected type are indicated (color, vaccinated, docked, sterilized, documents available). The user specifies a description and has the opportunity to attach photos to the ad. The final stage is to indicate the price, with the ability to select the currency of the indicated price, as well as the ability to give the animal for free,

It is worth noting that the presentation of the ‚ÄúPublications‚Äù section changes depending on the number of user advertisements. If there are none, then the corresponding view is displayed with a proposal to publish the first ad; if the user has ads, his ads will be displayed as a collection.
